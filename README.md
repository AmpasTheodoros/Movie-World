# Movie World

This repository contains a website for a fictional movie streaming service called "Movie World". The website allows users to browse and search for movies, view details and trailers, and add movies to their watchlist.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes a homepage with featured movies and a search bar.
- Users can search for movies by title, genre, or year.
- The website includes pages for each movie, with details such as the synopsis, cast, and trailer.
- Users can add movies to their watchlist and view their watchlist on their profile page.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the website such as:

- The ability for users to create an account and save their watchlist.
- The ability for users to rate and review movies.
- Integration with a payment system for users to purchase or rent movies.
